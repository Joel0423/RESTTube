Description:
1.Microservice Development:

    Task: Develop a microservice based application that provides a simple RESTful API. The API should handle basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a resource (e.g., a user profile, to-do list, book catalog).

Requirements: 

    Use a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).
    Implement the API with a framework suited for your chosen language (e.g., Flask/Django for Python,
    Spring Boot for Java, Express.js for Node.js).
    Ensure the microservice can connect to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store and retrieve
    data.

2.Containerization:

    Task: Containerize the microservice using Docker.

Requirements:

    Write a Dockerfile to build the microservice image.
    Create a Docker Compose file to run the microservice and the database as separate containers.
    Ensure the microservice and database containers can communicate with each other.

3. Deployment: 

    Task: Deploy the microservice to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or a container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes)
